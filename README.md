# 32-Bit-RISC-CPU-Design

An introductory project to get me familiar with Verilog, computer architecture, and digital designs. 

## Program Counter

* [**PC**](https://github.com/johnsonnguyenn/32-Bit-RISC-CPU-Design/tree/main/Register)

A program counter is a register that stores the memory address of the next instruction that is to be executed. This was implemented and coded via Verilog by designing a simple flip-flop register.
The program counter will either load a new address, or move to the next instruction by implementing 4, hence each instruction is 4 bytes long.
